**I optimize other people's code for a living. This library is a good example of the kind of work I do for my commercial clients; it contains many unique and clever optimizations that allows it to perform better than anything else available. I'm happy to contribute optimized libraries to the open source community in addition to working on commercial projects. Whatever platform you're using, I can make significant improvements to your native code. Please contact me so that I can show you how.**<br>

<b>Why did you write it?</b>
LVGL is a popular UI library used in a wide variety of devices and products. I have seen a common cry for help when it comes to supporting new display devices. The aim of this collection of code is to painlessly enable a large list of popular displays and devices.<br>
